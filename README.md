# Image Stitching And Panorama Construction using Python and OpenCV

## Introduction:
Here I have generated panorama using simple technique based on image to image mapping (homography) to aligning images.
techniques for constructing panoramic image mosaics from sequences of images involves following steps:
1. keypoint detection and local invariant descriptors(sift)
2. keypoint matching
3. perspective warping between sequence of images.

## Input images:

![](https://github.com/sushlokshah/panorama/blob/master/image2.jpg)
![](https://github.com/sushlokshah/panorama/blob/master/image3.jpg)

## Result:
1. panorama using two images

1. panorama using three images
